### The VTEX voice represents our **core brand elements** in the way we communicate. It ensures that our writing embodies the **VTEX personality and quality standards** across all touchpoints.

When communicating with our audience, keep in mind these principles:

‚úÖ Find the balance between boldness, trustworthiness, and optimism to achieve the right tone.  
‚úÖ Always know who you are talking to.  
‚úÖ Our audience is the protagonist of every message. VTEX is the guide.  
‚úÖ Keep it simple and straight to the point.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these principles.

## Tone - Context

When writing documentation or creating a new interface, we are guiding the users to accomplish a task as efficiently as possible. 

We address the following audiences:

| Audience type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | New to ecommerce operations and VTEX, with little to no prior experience. Their main challenge is adapting to the platform and the ecommerce context. |
| **Operational** | Handles daily ecommerce tasks, such as SKU registration and promotion management. Familiar with the ecommerce context but may encounter problems that need help to be solvedcannot be solved alone. |
| **Highly Technical** | Builds or integrates technical solutions with VTEX. Works on store implementations and app development with our solutions, and integrations with partner systems via VTEX APIs, andor. Requires in-depth technical documentation that shows the characteristics of all our features and indicates how to solve business needs. | 

## Voice - Personality

VTEX is grounded in three pillars: **boldness, trustworthiness,** and **optimism.**   
This means we write with authority and to the point (boldness). This helps us build the trust of our clients as we help them, configure, troubleshoot, and enhance the platform (trustworthy). We do this in a confident and friendly way without alarming users (optimistic).

## Audience

VTEX is not the hero, **the audience is the hero, and VTEX is their guide**. We have so much to deliver to the world, and we tend to place ourselves as protagonists. Let's change this approach: when we present ourselves as a guide, we become the help they need to overcome their challenges. Let's see some examples:

**Talking to anybody**  
*In the Admin platform, users can create fully customized landing pages to suit their needs, such as showcasing special offers, highlighting promotions, or featuring other engaging content to enhance the user experience.* 

**Relatable**  
*In the Admin, you can create customized landing pages, such as pages for special offers or promotions.* 

**Audience-first**  
**It‚Äôs never about us**. We believe that our communication strategy is the most powerful resource to start a conversation, so it's crucial to understand **who we are talking to.** We talk to people who have a tech background. So our messaging should resonate with their expertise, using clear and direct language while addressing their specific challenges and needs. By focusing on practical solutions and technical insights, we aim to create meaningful connections and provide real value to merchants.

**Generic**  
*This feature allows merchants to display products that are most relevant to customers and to add or hide pre-selected products from search results, offering greater flexibility in tailoring the shopping experience.* 

**Empowering**  
*This feature allows you to display products that are more relevant to the customer and to add or hide pre-selected products from the search results.* 

## Concise messages

**Be straightforward**. As a complex solution, we already use many concepts and specific jargon, so we must make our texts as clear and direct as possible. Anyone reading our announcements should be able to relate to what we are saying. Also, **avoid repetitions and ambiguities**. Always re-read your text to make sure there aren't too many repeated or unclear terms/ideas.

| On point ‚úÖ | A bunch of noise üö´ |
| --- | --- |
| *There was an error saving this row. Please try again.* | *An issue occurred while attempting to save this row. Try again to ensure your changes are successfully saved.*  |

**Long story short:**

‚úÖ Always know who you are talking to.  
‚úÖ Our audience is the protagonist of every message. VTEX is the guide.  
‚úÖ Keep it simple and straight to the point.  
‚úÖ Find the balance between boldness, trustworthiness, and optimism to achieve the right tone.

**Don't be too informal or formal**

| Too informal ‚ùå | Just about right ‚úÖ | Too formal ‚ùå |
| --- | --- | --- |
| To change the SKU's EAN, just delete all the existing EANs linked to it first. | Delete EAN values associated with the SKU before updating the current SKU EAN. | In order to modify the existing EAN for the SKU, it is required to remove all EAN values currently associated with the SKU beforehand. |
| Offline payment options mean the customer has to do something outside the store to keep the transaction moving. | Offline payment conditions are those that need a customer action outside of the store environment so that the transaction can follow its flow. | Offline payment conditions refer to those that require the customer to take action outside the store environment to facilitate the continuation of the transaction process. |
