Reuse the same page title whenever possible, such as in the URL, title meta tag, and, when it applies, in a navigation entry.

| --------- | ------------ |
| • Page title: Orders <br> • Title meta tag: Orders <br> • URL: /orders <br> • Navigation entry: Orders | • Page title: Orders <br> • Title meta tag: Orders listing <br> • URL: /all-orders <br> • Navigation entry: Store orders |

#### In a form page, when an item is being edited, use the name of the item as the page title. When a new item is being created, use the word `New` followed by the item type.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| --------- | ------------ |
| • Christmas discount <br> • New promotion | • Promotion <br> • Untitled promotion |

#### In a listing page, use the type of item being listed as the page title. Include only nouns in the plural form and avoid adding an unnecessary prefix or suffix.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| --------- | ------------ |
| • Product <br> • Orders | • All products <br> • Orders listing |

### Modal

#### In a modal with a form or actions, use an action label as the title. If the modal was triggered by action, prefer to repeat the verb of the action that triggered the modal.
