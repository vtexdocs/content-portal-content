The indefinite article used before SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) can vary depending on its pronunciation. It can be pronounced either as individual letters (/ˌɛsˌkeɪˈjuː/), which requires “an,” or as a single syllable (/skjuː/), which takes “a.” At VTEX, we use the syllable pronunciation (/skjuː/), so the preferred form is “a SKU.”
