Onboarding articles introduce new users to a specific technology, tool, or system to facilitate the learning curve and enable them to become proficient and productive.

In this guide, you'll see the available template, general guidelines, and examples of Onboarding articles in this guide.

> ℹ️ Make sure to review the guidelines from the [Best practices for writing documentation](https://deploy-preview-4--language-hub.netlify.app/docs/documentation/best-practices-for-writing-documentation).

## Writing an onboarding article

| Topic | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Focus on Fundamentals** | Emphasize the core elements a user needs to understand to get started, such as critical dependencies, initial configurations, and key setup steps. Avoid overwhelming users with advanced configurations unless they're necessary for the initial usage.  |
| **Assets** | Whenever possible, include visuals such as diagrams, screenshots, or flowcharts. These can clarify complex processes and provide users with a quick reference. In the architecture section, a well-labeled diagram helps illustrate system components and interactions. |
| **Instructions** | For sections like **Quickstart**, make sure each step is actionable and, if needed, link to additional resources for deeper understanding. |
| **Links to Prerequisites and Further Learning** | Use links to redirect users to related technologies, documentation, and guides. For example, in the Next steps section, suggest related configurations or customizations and link to resources that expand on or complement the basic onboarding content. |
