At VTEX, our goal for documentation is to make everything as simple and clear as possible for users working with or interested in VTEX solutions.

We welcome contributions to VTEX documentation and encourage to help improve the user experience. There are several ways to contribute, depending on the documentation portal you're interested in and your preferred method. Please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](LINK) for more information.

Before contributing to the documentation, make sure to:

* [Define the documentation objectives](LINK)
* [Follow our Documentation style guide](LINK)

## Define the documentation structure

Before you start writing, it is important to understand your target audience and the specific goals of your documentation. To help you define the documentation objectives, answer the following questions:

* What do you want users to achieve after reading your documentation?
* What are the essential tasks or concepts they need to understand?
* What additional information could enhance user understanding?

#### Identify the audience

To help you define the audience, answer the following questions:

* Who is the target audience for that information?
* What are they trying to do?

At VTEX, we have the following audience as our documentation readers:

| Audience type | Description | Most common documentation types |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Beginner** | New to ecommerce operations and VTEX, with little to no prior experience. Their main challenge is adapting to the platform and the ecommerce context. | <ol> <li>[Conceptual guides](LINK)</li> <li>[Tutorials](LINK)</li> <li>[Announcements](LINK)</li> </ol> |
| **Operational** | Handles daily ecommerce tasks, such as SKU registration and promotion management. Familiar with the ecommerce context but may encounter problems that need help to be solved. | <ol> <li>[Conceptual guides](LINK)</li>  <li>[Tutorials](LINK)</li> <li>[How-to guides](LINK).</li> <li>[Troubleshooting](LINK)</li> <li>[Known issues](LINK)</li> <li>[Announcements](LINK)</li> <li>[Release notes](LINK)</li> </ol> |
| **Highly Technical** | Builds or integrates technical solutions with VTEX. Works on store implementations and app development with our solutions and integrations with partner systems via VTEX APIs and Requires in-depth technical documentation that shows the characteristics of all our features and indicates how to solve business needs. | <ol> <li>[Conceptual guides](LINK)</li> <li>[Tutorials](LINK)</li> <li>[How-to guides](LINK).</li> <li>[API reference guides](LINK)</li> <li>[Troubleshooting](LINK)</li> <li>[App development](LINK)</li> <li>[Known issues](LINK)</li> <li>[Announcements](LINK)</li> <li>[Release notes](LINK)</li> </ol> |

### Checklist to define the documentation objectives

To help you define the documentation context, see the checklist below:

- Audience  
  - Beginner  
  - Operational  
  - Developer  
- Learning category  
  - Awareness - The audience can describe or paraphrase a concept or feature.  
  - Comprehension - The audience can understand a concept to support decision-making.  
  - Applicable skill - The audience can follow instructions to complete a task.  
- Learning objective  
  What should someone be able to do or understand after reading this article? Choose one or two tasks or concepts that the content will discuss. Template example:  

  > "Create a guide on {add the guide’s purpose}. The guide should emphasize clarity, structure, and user-friendliness. It's intended for {add the guide’s audience}."


## Documentation style guide

This guideline is the VTEX interpretation of stylistics as a discipline and explains particular language choices when creating functional and technical content about our platform.

### Style guide principles

| Principle | Orientation | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Clarity and conciseness** | Use simple language and avoid jargon. Break down complex concepts into smaller, easier-to-understand steps. Use clear and informative headings and subheadings to guide readers through the documentation. | Instead of "Utilize the API endpoint for product creation," write, "Create a new product using the API." Use headings like "Getting Started", "Instructions", and "Advanced features". |
| **Consistency** | Maintain consistency in terminology, style, and formatting throughout the documentation. | Use the same terminology for similar concepts (e.g., "customer" instead of "client"). |
| **Completeness** | Make sure the documentation is both comprehensive and concise, covering all relevant topics with enough detail.   | If you are documenting a feature, include information on how to use it, common use cases, and potential troubleshooting steps. |
| **Usability** | Consider the user's perspective and write the documentation in a way that is easy to navigate and use. | Use clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points to organize the content. |
| **Logical flow** | Organize the content in a logical sequence that is easy to follow. | Start with an introduction, followed by detailed sections on specific topics. |
| **Media and code examples** | Use media such as diagrams, screenshots, and code examples to enhance understanding. | Use screenshots, diagrams, and code snippets to illustrate examples and ensure accuracy. Tip: Diagrams can help, like platform or product architecture diagrams, illustrate complex processes or relationships. |

For more details about these principles, see the [style guide section](LINK).
