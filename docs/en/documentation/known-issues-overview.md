[Known Issues](https://help.vtex.com/known-issues) inform users about identified problems in the VTEX platform or products, their current status, and potential solutions (workarounds) or permanent fixes. We constantly update these articles so you can anticipate potential issues and know that our team is aware of them.

In this article, you’ll see the difference between Known Issues, other types of articles, and Product Improvements, as well as an overview of a Known Issue article.

## Differences between Known Issues and other articles

When navigating VTEX documentation, it's important to understand the differences between article types, which have specific purposes. For example, Known Issues articles alert users to identified problems within the platform, providing updates, workarounds, or solutions. In contrast, Troubleshooting guides offer step-by-step instructions for fixing specific errors.

The table below provides a comparison between Known Issues and other article types:

| **Topic** | **Known Issue** | **Troubleshooting** | **Announcement** | **Release note** | **Tutorial** | **How-to guide** |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Goal** | Informing users of known issues within the platform and products and their workarounds or solutions. | Providing step-by-step instructions to solve specific problems or errors. | Communicating new features, changes, or important product information. | Communicating changes, improvements, or bug fixes. | Teaching users how to perform specific tasks or use a particular tool or feature. | Providing step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a specific task. |
| **Content focus** | Problem description, impact, workaround or solution, and status updates. | Troubleshooting steps, error messages, and potential causes. | New features, changes, or important information. | New features, bug fixes, improvements, known issues, and breaking changes. | Concepts, step-by-step instructions, and examples. | Specific tasks and procedures. |
| **Audience** | All users who may be affected by the known issue. | Users experiencing specific problems or errors. | All users of the product or feature announced in the article. | Technical users such as developers. | Users who want to learn how to use a specific tool or feature. | Users who need to perform a specific task. |
| **Article example** | [Benefits and taxes are not applied to services](https://help.vtex.com/known-issues/benefits-and-taxes-are-not-applied-to-services--4u12zyfc387daNQamFohA2) | [My store’s Site Editor is not working](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/my-stores-site-editor-is-not-working--3A6Ois91zEZ8zpKJp1wsP2) | [New error screen in the Admin](https://help.vtex.com/announcements/new-error-screen-in-the-admin--5EJK3khivMrd8SdHTCBhIw) | [New password field for sending secure data in the anti-fraud flow](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes/2024-11-04-new-password-field-for-sending-secure-data-in-the-anti-fraud-flow) | [Creating synonyms](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/creating-synonyms--5IfjhvjxNAvJGEWNn0AhOA) | [Starting a new FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project) |

## Guidelines on identifying known issues or product improvements

Both known issues and product improvements intend to enhance the product. However, while known issues focus on solving existing problems, product improvements aim to add new features or enhance existing ones.

To better illustrate the difference between them, consider the following:

| **Topic** | **Known issue** | **Product improvement** |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Definition** | An identified problem or bug in the product or platform. | A proposed change to enhance the product or the platform's functionality, usability, or performance. |
| **Focus** | Fixing existing problems. | Adding new features or improving existing ones. |
| **User impact** | Negative impact on user experience or functionality. | Positive impact on user experience or functionality. |
| **Example** | A button on a page doesn't work as expected. | Adding a new feature to filter search results. |
