## Objective

Establish a clear, consistent, and meaningful naming strategy for VTEX products, features, and projects to enhance brand identity, customer understanding, and market positioning. This strategy aims to ensure that names are descriptive, practical, and aligned with industry standards, making them easy to spell, pronounce, and remember.

By implementing these guidelines, VTEX will create a cohesive naming convention that facilitates communication, supports marketing efforts, and strengthens the overall VTEX brand in the global marketplace.

Why have a naming process?

**Consistency:** Ensures all names align with the [brand's identity and values](https://brand.vtex.com/), creating a unified image.

**Clarity:** Helps customers easily understand what each product, feature, or module does, reducing confusion.

**Professionalism:** Demonstrates a well-organized and thoughtful approach, enhancing the company's reputation.

**Market Positioning:** Differentiates VTEX products from competitors and clearly communicates their unique value.

**Global Relevance:** Ensures names are appropriate and understandable across different languages and cultures.

**Efficiency:** Streamlines the naming process, saving time and resources by providing clear guidelines and reducing the need for ad-hoc decisions.

**Marketing and SEO:** Improves searchability and marketing effectiveness by using names that are easy to find and understand online.

When does this process apply?

* Launching new products;
* Developing features and modules;
* Updating existing names;
* Adapting names for different regions and languages.

When to run the naming process?

**The sooner, the better.** Ideally, run this process at least 2 months before rolling out to closed beta.

### General guidelines

Names must be:

**Meaningful:** Conveys relevant meaning and fits within the industry; use terms that are commonly used and easily recognizable by merchants.

**Unique:** Differentiates from competitors and is not too generic.

**Memorable:** Easy to remember and recognize.

**Easy to Spell:** Should be spelled as it is pronounced.

**Easy to Pronounce:** Should be pronounced as it is spelled.

**Brief:** Limited to one or two words, max of three, or a compound word.

**Weighty:** Conveys strength and importance.

**Global Relevance:** Ensure names are easy to understand in different languages and cultures.

**SEO Friendly:** Names should be searchable and rankable.

**Word Choice:** Opt for words with positive connotations and impact to ensure memorable and engaging names.

Specific guidelines

**Versioning and Updates:** Use [semantic versioning](https://www.notion.so/vtexhandbook/POC-MVP-Alpha-Beta-what-and-when-do-we-communicate-things-6eee838febdd48feb0d60d00b9173ffa) for updates to existing features rather than renaming them. Add “(Beta)” for test pages and “(Legacy)” for outdated systems.

**Translations:**  We use different translation strategies for products, modules, and features to ensure brand consistency and recognition across all markets.

**Products:** Keep in English.

* Examples: Sales App, Live Shopping, FastStore.
  **VTEX Admin Modules:** Translated.
* Examples: Overview / Visão geral, Shipping / Envio, Orders / Pedidos
  **Permission Roles:** Not translated.
* Examples: Owner (Admin Super), VTEX IO Admin.
  **Features:** Translated.
* Example: Operational capacity / Capacidade operacional.
  **Apps:** Some are translated, some are not.
* Examples: Wishlist / Lista de desejos, Customer Credit.

**Capitalization:** Capitalization rules differ by language. Use title case for titles in English, and sentence case in Portuguese and Spanish. For more details, see our [style guides](https://language.vtex.com/content/style_guides.html) or contact the Localization team.

**Character Limit:**

* Modules \- 18 characters
* Sections \- 16 characters
* Subsections \- 21 characters


What to avoid

* Don’t use verbs. For example, use “Available Sellers” instead of “Find Sellers.”
* Don’t use punctuation.
* Don’t use personal pronouns.
* Avoid redundancy or repeat unnecessary terms. Example: avoid repeating the section title, such as when using the words *Management* or *List*.

* Avoid using abbreviations unless they are widely recognized and understood, such as “B2B” or “SKU.”
