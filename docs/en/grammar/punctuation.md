In a UI, the goal is to minimize distractions and guide users through clear actions and messages. The UI must be concise, functional, and often minimal in its use of punctuation.

Avoid using periods to end single sentences, particularly in labels, label description text, tooltip text, bulleted lists, dialog body text, hyperlinked text, titles, and buttons containing a sentence.

Use periods on long or complex sentences, paragraphs with multiple sentences, and any sentence followed by a link.
